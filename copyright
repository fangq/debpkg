Comment:  ZMat is a portable C library to enable easy-to-use data compression
 and decompression (such as zlib/gzip/lzma/lzip/lz4/lz4hc algorithms)
 and base64 encoding/decoding in an application.
 It is fast and compact, can process a large array within a fraction
 of a second. Among the supported compression methods, lz4 is the
 fastest for compression/decompression; lzma is the slowest but has
 the highest compression ratio; zlib/gzip have the best balance
 between speed and compression time.
